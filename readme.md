## This is a Bash Script

### this project includes
* Just bash commands


### Synopsis
this is just a bash script the runs bash commands that will push your updated work
to github or whatever remote repository you are using in one command. to use this, you can fork and clone this repository than put the command as an executable in your
class path. If this is confusing to you, you can reach out to me personally at
charles.lamb.dev@gmail.com and I will assist you. enjoy!!


### the catch
this command is supposed to make everything easier however there is a catch in
this case. while the command works, you have to make sure that you are in the
directory that you have changed or in a directory above it, otherwise you 
changes will not be commited. other than that it will work just fine. the 
reason for this is because under the hood the command used is git add .., which
will add the contents of the current folder and everything underneath it.



### Biggest challenges
here my biggest challenge was learning about how bash scripts can be turned
into executable commands, however it was not very challenging at all, and
now I use executable custom scripts all the time.


### Code Review
the code simply takes in what you type and makes it your commit message to send
to your remote repository.

### final thought
I learned a lot doing this because not only was it my first custom script that 
I created but it helped me speed up my productivity by not having to use three
steps just to push my latest commit.
